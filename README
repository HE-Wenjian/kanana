This is a preliminary version of Katana, a toolchain-oriented
hotpatching system for userland (in contrast to kernel-patching
systems such as KSplice) and a (somewhat) general-purpose ELF and
DWARF manipulation tool. More complete documentation will reside in
./doc, although such is currently in a very early state


DEPENDENCIES
libelf
  widely available with a couple different implementations. I
  recommend the one from Red Hat at
  https://fedorahosted.org/elfutils/. The FSF version
  (http://directory.fsf.org/project/libelf/) which is the default
  available to gentoo users, does not seem to be fully compatible.
libdwarf
  you can get the latest version of libdwarf from
  http://reality.sgiweb.org/davea/dwarf.html. 
libunwind
  http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/
libreadline
  http://www.gnu.org/software/readline/
bison
  http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/
flex
  http://flex.sourceforge.net/

BUILDING
./configure
make

Note that flex and bison (as well as gcc, of course) are required to
build Katana.

make
./install libdwarf.so DEST

TESTING
To make sure katana works:
make check

Note that at present this only tests the hotpatching features of katana

USAGE
  Katana presently has two main functions
  HOTPATCHING
    To generate a patch file, run
    katana -g [-o OUT_FULE] OLD_OBJECT_TREE NEW_OBJECT_TREE EXEC
    (EXEC is the name of the executable file whose process will be patched)

    To patch a process run
    katana -p PATCH_FILE PID

  ELF/DWARF Manipulation
