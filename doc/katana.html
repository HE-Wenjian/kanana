<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>Katana is a research system for ELF/DWARF manipulation. It was
originally developed for research into hotpatching. It was later
revised for research into security implication of gcc/C++ exception
handling, which is implemented primarily using DWARF call frame
information. Therefore, if you are interested in vulnerabilities
related to exceptiong handling/DWARF you may probably ignore the
parts of this manual which discuss hotpatching. If you are instead
interested in hotpatching, you may probably ignore the parts of this
manual that deal with manipulating exception handling structures.
</p>
<p>
Katana aims to provide a hot-patching system for userland. Further
it aims to work with existing toolchains and formats so as to be
easy to use and to hopefully pave the way for incorporating patching
as a standard part of the toolchain. Because of this aim, Katana
operates at the object level rather than requiring any access to the
source code itself. This has the added bonus of making it, in
theory, language agnostic (although no work has been done to test it
with anything besides programs written in C). A diagram of software
lifecycle with hotpatching is shown below (unless you are reading this in plain text)
</p>



<img src="./software_lifecycle.png" /><br /><br />


<p>
This document is intended to provide a users guide to Katana,
insight into its inner workings, and discussion of its flaws and
plans for the future. As the software is not complete, making use of
Katana without understanding the inner workings and technical
shortcomings is not recommended. Nevertheless, the only sections of
this document necessary for "Users' Guide" purposes are 
<a href="#sec-3.2">"What Katana Does"</a>, <a href="#sec-3.3">"What Katana Does Not Do (Yet)"</a>, and most importantly 
<a href="#sec-3.5">"How to Use Katana For Hotpatching"</a>.
</p>
<p>
This document is a work in progress. It is not a polished guide yet.

<div id="outline-container-2.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Shell </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.1">

<p>If Katana is not passed an argument indicating one of the
hot-patching commands (described later in  <a href="#sec-3.5">*How to Use Katana For Hotpatching</a>), then it is assumed to be operating as a shell. If it
is provided an argument, that argument is taken as the name of a
file to read shell commands from. Otherwise commands are read from
stdin using the readline library. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.1.1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2.1.1"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.1</span> Syntax and Data Model </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2.1.1">

<p>The Katana shell syntax is very simple. There are no control flow
structures, only commands and variables. A line is terminated by a
semicolon (;) or a newline character. Each line may be either
blank, contain exactly one COMMAND, or contain an ASSIGNMENT.
</p>
<p>
A COMMAND is of the form COMMAND_IDENTIFIER PARAM PARAM PARAM &hellip;., where
tokens are seperated by spaces and the number of PARAMs depends on
the command.
</p>
<p>
An ASSIGNMENT is currently of the form VARIABLE=COMMAND although
in the future it may be possible to write other sorts of
assignments.
</p>
<p>
A VARIABLE reference consists of a dollar-sign ($) followed by a
letter or underscore followed by any number of letters,
underscores, or digits.
</p>
<p>
A COMMAND_IDENTIFIER is one or more words which identify a
COMMAND. In many cases a command is identified by only one word,
but sometimes similar commands are grouped by sharing the first
word in their identifier.
</p>
<p>
A PARAM is a VARIABLE reference, STRING, or NUMBER
</p>
<p>
A STRING is any literal beginning and ending with the character ".
</p>
<p>
A NUMBER is a decimal, hex, or float literal.

<h3 id="sec-3.1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Other Systems </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.1">

<p>There are other hotpatching systems in existence. The curious are
invited to explore Ginseng and Polus. Both of these systems parse
the source code, which adds significant complexity to them and
results in significant programmer annotation of the code to give
hints to the systems. Ginseng uses complicated type-wrappers
when patching variables which does not fit cleanly with existing
executables and has some impact on the performance of the
software. Ginseng is considerably more mature than Katana,
however. Neither system is production ready, but Ginseng is probably
closer than Katana at the moment.
</p>
<p>
The system most like Katana in many ways is KSplice, and the curious
reader is definitely invited to investigate. KSplice patches the
kernel and not userland, does not attempt to patch variables, and
creates patches as kernel modules rather than working towards a
general ELF-based patch format.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.5">

<p>Katana is intended to be used in two stages. The first stage
generates a patch object from two different versions of an
treee. By an object tree, we mean the set of object files (.o files)
and the executable binary they comprise. Katana works completely at
the object level, so the source code itself is not strictly
required, although all objects must be compiled with debugging
information. This step may be done by the software vendor. In the
second stage, the patch is applied to a running process. The
original source trees are not necessary during patch application, as
the patch object contains all information necessary to patch the
in-memory process at the object level. It is also possible to view
the contents of a patch object in a human-readable way for the
purposes of sanity-checking, determining what changes the patch
makes, etc.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3.5.1">

<p>Katana aims to be much less invasive than other hot-patching system
and require minimal work to be used with any project. It does,
however, have some requirements.<br/>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3.5.2">

<p>Katana does not look at the source code, therefore unlike several
other hotpatching systems, it does not require any annotation in
the source code. There are, however, some best practices to
follow.
</p><ul>
<li>
Avoid the use of <code>void*</code> at least for global variables (since
Katana does not currently patch local variables, preferring to
wait until any functions using changed variables are no longer
on the stack). Since it is typeless and opaque, it is very hard
to analyze and patch.
</li>
<li>
Avoid unnamed types. i.e., instead of <code>typedef struct {...} Foo;</code>
use <code>typedef struct Foo_ {...} Foo;</code>. 
</li>
<li>
Avoid accessing structure members by offsets instead of by the
member names. As long as you keep all the code where you do this
up to date, it should not be a problem, but katana cannot detect
when you do this.

<p>Let the location of your project be /project. You must have two
versions of your software available: the version identical to the
running software which must be hotpatched, call it v0, and the
version to which you wish to hotpatch the running software, call it
v1. Let foo be the name of your program. Then /project/v0/foo must
exist and /project/v0 must also contain (possibly in
subdirectories) all of the object files which contributed to
/project/v0/foo. The source code itself is immaterial, as Katana
does not parse it. Similarly, /project/v1/foo must exist and
/project/v1 contain all of the object files contributing to
/project/v1/foo. Katana is then invoked as
</p>
<p>
<code>katana [OPTIONS] -g [-o OUTPUT_FILE] /project/v0 /project/v1 foo</code>
</p>
<p>
or more formally
</p>
<p>
<code>katana [OPTIONS] -g [-o OUTUT_FILE] OLD_OBJECTS_DIR NEW_OBJECTS_DIR EXECUTABLE_NAME</code>

<p>The process to be patched is running with a pid of PID. It can be
patched from its current version to a more recent version by the
Patch Object (PO) file PATCH. Katana is then invoked as
</p>
<p>
<code>katana [OPTIONS] -p [-s] PATCH PID</code>
</p>
<p>
If all goes well, the patcher will run, print out some status
messages, and leave your program in better state than it found
it. The optional -s flag tells Katana to stop the target program
after patching it and detaching from it. This is mostly of use for
debugging Katana.

<p>Configuration files are written in JSON. The JSON requirement that
strings be quoted is relaxed (i.e. anything is assumed to be a
string unless it can be interpreted otherwise). The following
properties are recognized:
</p><ul>
<li>
maxWaitForPatching &lt;INTEGER&gt;
This value specifies the maximum number of seconds to wait for
the target to enter a safe state.
</li>
<li>
flags &lt;OBJECT&gt;
The value of flags should be an object which may contain the
following properties, all of which should be bool-valued:
<ul>
<li>
checkPtraceWrites
Whenever something is written into the target memory, read the
value back out and verify that it was written correctly. This
has a performance penalty, but does provide some more robust
error checking, although it should not be necessary.

<h3 id="sec-3.6"><span class="section-number-3">3.6</span> Patch Object Format </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.6">

<p>We have developed a patch object (PO) format which we hope will
eventually pave the way for a standardized vendor-neutral patch
format for hotpatching. We are not advancing our format as such,
but it embodies some of the principles which we think are
important. Why should patching not be a part of the ABI and of the
standard toolchain?
</p><ul>
<li>
A PO is a valid ELF file.
</li>
<li>
A PO utilizes DWARF information to describe types, variables, and
functions requiring patching.
</li>
<li>
A PO allows type transformations to be specified using a language
based on the DWARF standard.

</li>
</ul>

<p>Through the use of existing standards and well-structured ELF files
utilizing a simple expression language for data patching, we aim to
create patches that are easily examined (or modified) with existing
tools. Relocatable objects containing new code and data which may
be inserted at runtime are nothing new. This is the entire premise
of the dynamic library. User-written functions which may have this
code injection (in the case of patching data where the desired
actions cannot be determined automatically) already exist as the
.init and .fini sections. It is our view, however, that it is
important to have a seperate patch format as opposed to patches
merely being dynamic libraries which contain both the patch data
and the logic to perform the patching (as is done by some other
hotpatching systems). We view this as an unnecessary mixing of data
and logic. The code to apply patches should live in one place on
any given system, as most other executable content does.
</p>
<p>
As an ELF object, our PO files contain the following non-standard
sections.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
.text.new
Contains new/modified functions
</li>
<li>
.rodata.new, .data.new
new data
</li>
<li>
.unsafe_functions
Contains a simple listing (of symbol indices) of the functions in
the binary to be patched which should not have activation records
on the stack when patching is taking place. 
</li>
<li>
.debug_info
Contains listings of the variables and functions which need to be
patched using the DWARF data format. This section is standard and
is used here with validly formatted data, but is used for
patching instead of debugging. The use of the the .debug_ name is
preserved for compatibility with libdwarf and tools such as
readelf, objdump, dwarfdump capable of listing DWARF
information. It can be, however, confusing and the name will
likely change in the future.
</li>
<li>
.debug_frame
Like .debug_info a standard section used in a nonstandard way,
see notes above about the naming. Contains an extended version of
DWARF Call Frame Information which describes how various data
structures are to be patched. The details are not properly
documented at the moment, please email the Authors for more
details if you would like further information.

</ul>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.10">

<p>High level view:
</p><ul>
<li>
Katana compare the old and new source trees, looking at the object (.o)
files.
</li>
<li>
For object files which exist only in the new tree, their contents
are added to the patch object being created.
</li>
<li>
For object files which exist only in the old tree, a warning
about their removal is issued and nothing further is done.
</li>
<li>
For object files which exist in both trees, type diffing and
function diffing are performed and the differences are written
tot he patch object being created.

</li>
</ul>

<p>A more detailed (although still very rough) algorithm:
</p>


<pre class="example">Walk the old and new object trees in parallel
  For each pair of objects (corresponding old and new objects)
    If the new object does not exist
      Issue a warning and continue
    If the old object does not exist
      Add all functions and vars to patch
      Continue
    If the two objects are the same
      Continue
    If the two objects differ
      For every global variable in the old object
        Compare with matching variable in the new object
        If the two are a different type or the type struct changes
          Generate a type transformation for the patch
        If the variable initializers changed
          If the variable is const
            Add new data to the patch
          Else
            Generate a warning (can't determine automatically if
                the change should be applied)
        If anything related to the variable changed
          Find all functions using the variable
          Add them to the unsafe functions list
      For every global variable only in the new object
        Add it to the patch
      For every function in the old object
        Compare with matching function in the new object
          If the functions differ
            Add the new text to the patch
            Add the function to the unsafe functions list.
      For ever function only in the new object
        Add the function to the patch
Write out the patch ELF!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.12">

<p>Functions are compared in an unsophisticated manner. The comparison
is essentially byte-by-byte (i.e. no parsing of the machine
instruction set is done). If bytes differ between the compiled
version of the old function and the new function, then the function
is assumed to need patching.  The one exception to this is that
relocations are accounted for. If bytes differ at an address that
is fixed up by relocations, the relocations are examined to make
sure that they are for the same symbol. If in fact they are, then
the function is deemed not to have changed. If the symbol referred
to corresponds to a variable that has changed then it may need to
be moved to be patched. In that event the function may in fact have
to be modified, but it will be modified only to apply the
relocations rather than as a patch to the function per se and thus
the function diffing stage does not concern itself with whether
referenced symbols have changed.

<p>This section of the document is not yet written. It will provide a
description of the internal process that Katana uses to apply a
patch. Understanding it is not necessary for using Katana.
</p>
<p>
The basic process is as follows
</p>


<pre class="example">Read the patch file
Calculate versioning. This is currently not implemented.
Find malloc in the target, as we may need it
Calculate a safe state for the target (based on the unsafe functions list)
Wait for the target to reach a safe state
Map in necessary sections from the patch
Copy PLT and GOT to new locations as we may need to expand them
For each variable listed in the patch
  Apply the variable patch
For each function listed in the patch
 Apply the function patch
Apply necessary relocations
