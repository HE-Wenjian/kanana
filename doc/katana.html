<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>Katana aims to provide a hot-patching system for userland. Further
it aims to work with existing toolchains and formats so as to be
easy to use and to hopefully pave the way for incorporating patching
as a standard part of the toolchain. Because of this aim, Katana
operates at the object level rather than requiring any access to the
source code itself. This has the added bonus of making it, in
theory, language agnostic (although no work has been done to test it
with anything besides programs written in C). A diagram of software
lifecycle with hotpatching is shown below
</p>



<img src="./software_lifecycle.png" /><br /><br />


<p>
This document is intended to provide a users guide to Katana,
insight into its inner workings, and discussion of its flaws and
plans for the future. As the software is not complete, making use of
Katana without understanding the inner workings and technical
shortcomings is not recommended. Nevertheless, the only sections of
this document necessary for "Users' Guide" purposes are 
<a href="#sec-3">"What Katana Does"</a>, <a href="#sec-4">"What Katana Does Not Do (Yet)"</a>, and most importantly 
<a href="#sec-6">"How to Use Katana"</a>.
</p>
<p>
This document is a work in progress. It is not a polished guide yet.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Other Systems </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>There are other hotpatching systems in existence. The curious are
invited to explore Ginseng and Polus. Both of these systems parse
the source code, which adds significant complexity to them and
results in significant programmer annotation of the code to give
hints to the systems. Ginseng uses complicated type-wrappers
when patching variables which does not fit cleanly with existing
executables and has some impact on the performance of the
software. Ginseng is considerably more mature than Katana,
however. Neither system is production ready, but Ginseng is probably
closer than Katana at the moment.
</p>
<p>
The system most like Katana in many ways is KSplice, and the curious
reader is definitely invited to investigate. KSplice patches the
kernel and not userland, does not attempt to patch variables, and
creates patches as kernel modules rather than working towards a
general ELF-based patch format.

<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> How to Use Katana </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">

<p>Katana is intended to be used in two stages. The first stage
generates a patch object from two different versions of an
treee. By an object tree, we mean the set of object files (.o files)
and the executable binary they comprise. Katana works completely at
the object level, so the source code itself is not strictly
required, although all objects must be compiled with debugging
information. This step may be done by the software vendor. In the
second stage, the patch is applied to a running process. The
original source trees are not necessary during patch application, as
the patch object contains all information necessary to patch the
in-memory process at the object level. It is also possible to view
the contents of a patch object in a human-readable way for the
purposes of sanity-checking, determining what changes the patch
makes, etc.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-6.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6.1"><span class="section-number-3">6.1</span> Preparing a Package for Patching Support </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6.1">

<p>Katana aims to be much less invasive than other hot-patching system
and require minimal work to be used with any project. It does,
however, have some requirements.<br/>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-6.1.1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-6.1.1"><span class="section-number-4">6.1.1</span> Source Code Practices </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6.1.1">

<p>Katana does not look at the source code, therefore unlike several
other hotpatching systems, it does not require any annotation in
the source code. There are, however, some best practices to
follow.
</p><ul>
<li>
Avoid the use of <code>void*</code> at least for global variables (since
Katana does not currently patch local variables, preferring to
wait until any functions using changed variables are no longer
on the stack). Since it is typeless and opaque, it is very hard
to analyze and patch.
</li>
<li>
Avoid unnamed types. i.e., instead of <code>typedef struct {...} Foo;</code>
use <code>typedef struct Foo_ {...} Foo;</code>. 
</li>
<li>
Avoid accessing structure members by offsets instead of by the
member names. As long as you keep all the code where you do this
up to date, it should not be a problem, but katana cannot detect
when you do this.
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-6.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6.2"><span class="section-number-3">6.2</span> To Generate a Patch </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6.2">

<p>Let the location of your project be /project. You must have two
versions of your software available: the version identical to the
running software which must be hotpatched, call it v0, and the
version to which you wish to hotpatch the running software, call it
v1. Let foo be the name of your program. Then /project/v0/foo must
exist and /project/v0 must also contain (possibly in
subdirectories) all of the object files which contributed to
/project/v0/foo. The source code itself is immaterial, as Katana
does not parse it. Similarly, /project/v1/foo must exist and
/project/v1 contain all of the object files contributing to
/project/v1/foo. Katana is then invoked as
</p>
<p>
<code>katana -g [-o OUTPUT_FILE] /project/v0 /project/v1 foo</code>
</p>
<p>
or more formally
</p>
<p>
<code>katana -g [-o OUTUT_FILE] OLD_OBJECTS_DIR NEW_OBJECTS_DIR EXECUTABLE_NAME</code>
</p>
<p>
If <code>-o OUTPUT_FILE</code> is not specified, the output file will be <code>OLD_OBJECTS_DIR/EXECUTABLE_NAME.po</code>
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-6.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6.3"><span class="section-number-3">6.3</span> To Apply a Patch </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6.3">

<p>The process to be patched is running with a pid of PID. It can be
patched from its current version to a more recent version by the
Patch Object (PO) file PATCH. Katana is then invoked as
</p>
<p>
<code>katana -p [-s] PATCH PID</code>
</p>
<p>
If all goes well, the patcher will run, print out some status
messages, and leave your program in better state than it found
it. The optional -s flag tells Katana to stop the target program
after patching it and detaching from it. This is mostly of use for
debugging Katana.

<h3 id="sec-6.4"><span class="section-number-3">6.4</span> To View a Patch </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6.4">

<p>One of the goals of Katana and its Patch Object (PO) format is to
increase the transparency of patches: a user about to apply a patch
should know what it will do. This goal is not yet fully realized,
but it is possible to view some information about a patch with
</p>
<p>
<code>katana -l PATCH</code>

Patch composition

Patch safety checking: make sure a patch actually corresponds to
the process it's being applied to
